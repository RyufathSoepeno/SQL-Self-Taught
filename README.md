# SQL-Self-Taught

To run in MySQL workbench, click the database icon, click ok, enter the password after pressing the ok button, and run the codes by highlighting a line, and clicking the thunder button after the selected highlight. 

Some require to use CommandLine, to run, just press enter after deciding a delimiter (The default delimiter is (;), so remember that)

Tip: Dependencies in SQL mean one entity or query cannot work without ahving the other query or entity

B is Dependent on A

If A does not exist, B cannot work
