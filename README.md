# SQL-Self-Taught

To run in MySQL workbench, click the database icon, click ok, enter the password after pressing the ok button, and run the codes by highlighting a line, and clicking the thunder button after the selected highlight. 

Some require to use CommandLine, to run, just press enter after deciding a delimiter (The default delimiter is (;), so remember that)

Yours, 
Ryufath ;-)
